It took a while, so during that time, Connor decided to turn himself into memes. Clearly, as the subathon was reaching its conclusion, Connor was losing more and more of his sanity.



Also, please be nice to Mousey. She was medicated, so a bit loopy. It was very late for her too, and she was very kind to spend around 8 hours playing with Connor.
